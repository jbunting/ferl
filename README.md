# Ferl


A simple, flexible JSR-94 rules engine that uses JSR-223 script engines for defining rules.

ferl is intended to provide a simple yet flexible implementation of JSR-94. RuleExecutionSets are defined as a simple list of rules. Rules are defined with the name of a JSR-223 scripting engine and the script. One other key factor in flexibility is the ability to plugin a custom storage mechanism.
